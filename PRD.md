# Product Requirements Document (PRD): HTTPayer

**Version:** 0.0.1\
**Status:** DRAFT\
**Owner:** Brandyn Hamilton\
**Target Release:** v0.0.1

## 1. Background & Strategic Fit

HTTPayer enables automated, cross-chain stablecoin payments for APIs, agents,
and smart contracts using the x402 protocol and Chainlink CCIP. It bridges
Web2/Web3, allowing seamless monetization and programmable payments for digital
services.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

- Monetize APIs and digital services with stablecoin paywalls
- Automate payments and abstract wallet UX for users/agents
- Enable cross-chain liquidity/payments (Chainlink CCIP)
- Allow smart contracts to consume paid APIs (Chainlink Functions)
- Provide developer-friendly SDKs (Python, TypeScript)

## 3. Requirements & User Stories

| # | Title                 | Description                                           | Priority    |
| - | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1 | API Monetization      | Providers require stablecoin payment for API access   | Must Have   |
| 2 | Automated Payments    | Users/agents pay for APIs without manual wallet steps | Must Have   |
| 3 | Cross-chain Liquidity | Accept payments from multiple EVM chains              | Must Have   |
| 4 | Smart Contract Access | Contracts trigger paid API calls and receive data     | Should Have |
| 5 | Developer SDKs        | Easy-to-use SDKs for Python/TypeScript                | Must Have   |
| 6 | Dashboard & Demo UI   | Web UI for wallet connect, balances, and payment demo | Should Have |

## 4. User Interaction & Design

- **Frontend:** Next.js/Tailwind dashboard for wallet connect, live balances,
  payment demo
- **SDKs:** Python (decorator/client), TypeScript (middleware/client)
- **API:** `/httpayer`, `/treasury/*`, `/facilitator/*` endpoints
- See [frontend/ARCHITECTURE.md](frontend/ARCHITECTURE.md) for UI/UX details

## 5. Open Questions

- How to best support new EVM chains? (facilitator/treasury updates)
- Chainlink Functions reliability for on-chain triggers?
- Future fiat onramp integration?
- Error handling and retries for failed payments?

## 6. Out of Scope

- Native mobile app (web UI only)
- Non-EVM chain support (future)
- Fiat onramp/offramp (future)
- Manual payment flows (fully automated)

## 7. Success Metrics

- Number of APIs/paywalls integrated
- Successful cross-chain payments
- SDK adoption (PyPI/npm downloads)
- Smart contract usage via Chainlink Functions
- User/agent satisfaction with payment UX
